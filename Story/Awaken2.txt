*You mutter to yourself about the strangness of the name*
*Suddenly you feel feel a hand on your shoulder*
*You turn around and see a beautiful young woman*
*She starts to talk to you*

Her: Well hello there stranger, I havent see your face around here before.

*You are weary of speaking too much about what happend to you,
even you aren't too sure of exactly happend, so you decide to play along*

You: Yeah i'm just passing through.
Her: Well, I run a local Inn, Do you a place to rest for a bit?

*You want to say no, but then you think about the dangers of spending a night
on the steets of a town you don't know*

You: Sure. Thank you.
Her: Don't worry about it. So what your name?
