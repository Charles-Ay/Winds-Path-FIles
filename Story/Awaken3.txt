Her: Nice to meet you [player]. My name is Sarah if you where wondering.
Sarah: Now then lets get going.

*Sarah takes you to the inn and gives you a room*
*You sleep soundly and wake up refreshed*

Sarah: Morning [player], sleep well?
You: Just a little bit.
Sarah: Aren't you forgetting something?

*You state at Sarah with a blank expression on your face. 
You cant seem to remeber what you possibly could have forgotten*

You: No I dont think so.
Sarah: You haven't payed for your room yet.

*You start to panic when you realize that you are broke*
*Sarah sees the expression on your face*

Sarah: Well seeing as you have no money. You gotta pay me back some way.
Sarah: Come with me and ill show you how to earn some money.

*Sarah takes you through the town*

Sarah: This is the town Dungeon. Here you can kill monsters for gold and sometimes rare loot.

Sarah: Over there is the adventurer store. There you can go and buy better weapons and equipment.

Sarah: Ill leave you to it. Come back to me when you have 70G

*Your jaw drops when you hear the amount*
*You feel scammed*
*You turn to face the dungon*
